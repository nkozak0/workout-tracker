How to Make Your Workout App Installable

Turning your website into a Progressive Web App (PWA) allows you to install it on your home screen, run it offline, and hide the browser URL bar.

Step 1: Install the PWA Plugin

Open your terminal in your project folder (where you ran npm create vite) and run:

npm install vite-plugin-pwa -D


Step 2: Add Icons (Important!)

For the app to look good on your home screen, you need an icon.

Find or create a square logo for your app (at least 512x512 pixels).

Name one copy pwa-192x192.png (resize if needed).

Name another copy pwa-512x512.png.

Place these two files in the public/ folder of your project.

Step 3: Deploy

Since you have this on GitHub, the easiest way to get it on your phone is to deploy it for free using Vercel or Netlify.

Go to Vercel.com and sign up with GitHub.

Click "Add New Project" and select your workout-tracker repository.

Click "Deploy".

Vercel will give you a URL (e.g., https://workout-tracker.vercel.app).

Step 4: Install on Your Phone

On iPhone (iOS):

Open your new Vercel URL in Safari.

Tap the Share button (box with an arrow up).

Scroll down and tap "Add to Home Screen".

The app will appear on your home screen like a native app!

On Android:

Open your new Vercel URL in Chrome.

Tap the three dots menu.

Tap "Install App" or "Add to Home Screen".
